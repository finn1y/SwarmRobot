# Agent Simulation

This directory includes a python simulation of an agent (robot), primarily simulating the MQTT connection. 
It also includes an OpenAI Gym environment which is used to simulate the environment the agent is interacting with - the built-in environment is a maze environment, however this can be changed for any envioronment the user desires.
